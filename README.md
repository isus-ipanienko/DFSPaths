example graph in graph.csv

each line represents a single edge (left column is the `from` vertex, right is the `to` vertex)

the program takes three arguments: a path to the graph file, a `from` vertex, a `to` vertex

it prints out the total number of paths between given vertices (assuming you may or may not stop at each vertex)
